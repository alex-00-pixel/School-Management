Software Requirements: -
To develop the C++ Student Report Management Project, the following software and hardware requirements are needed:

Software Requirements:

    1. A C++ IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Visual Studio or Code::Blocks
    2. A text editor such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text
    3. A version control system (VCS) like Git

Hardware Requirements:

    1. A computer with a minimum of sufficient RAM.
    2. Sufficient storage space for the development environment and the database management system
    3. A processor that supports the C++ compiler and IDE
    4. A stable internet connection for downloading and installing software libraries and dependencies.

Additionally, it's essential to ensure that the software and hardware requirements are compatible and meet 
the project's specifications. For example, the computer's processor 
must be compatible with the IDE and the project's requirements.

In summary, developing the C++ Student Report Management Project requires a computer with sufficient hardware specifications, 
an appropriate C++ IDE, a text editor, and a version control system. By ensuring that the software and 
hardware requirements are met, the project can be developed efficiently and effectively.
